Expert Consensus Rankings are an average of rankings from a large amount of experts 
for each player for a given season or week. 
We are clustering players in to tiers based on average expert rankings for the draft.
Using the KMeans algorithm which requires us to input the number of clusters
so we use silhoutte analysis to determine what number of clusters to input

'''
Use silhouette analysis to determine the k value (number of clusters) to be used for KMeans algorithm 
The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) 
compared to other clusters (separation). 
The silhouette ranges from âˆ’1 to +1, higher value indicates that the object 
is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.
